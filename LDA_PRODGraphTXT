To visualize the results of your Value at Risk (VaR) analysis effectively, we can create several types of plots that summarize the information clearly. Here are some suggested visualizations you can create using Matplotlib and Seaborn:

Bar Plots for VaR by Year and Business Line: This will show how VaR changes across different business lines over the years. Line Plots for Total Net Loss by Year: This will illustrate trends in total net loss over the years. Pie Charts for Event ID Count Percentage: This can visualize the proportion of event IDs across different categories. Bar Plots for VaR Percentage: To show how VaR relates to total net loss percentage-wise. Step-by-Step Implementation Here’s how you can implement these visualizations:

Step 1: Prepare Your Data Ensure your results DataFrame (var_percentage_df) is set up correctly. You should already have columns for Year, Business Line, Event Type, VaR, Total Net Loss, VaR Percentage, Event ID Count, and Event ID Percentage.

Step 2: Create the Visualizations Below are example codes for creating each type of graph

Based on the Value at Risk (VaR) results you provided for various distributions at a 95% confidence level, we can draw the following conclusions:

VaR Results Summary Normal Distribution: VaR = 26,343.40

This suggests that there is a 5% chance of a loss exceeding this amount in a given period. Log-Normal Distribution: VaR = 33,591.21

This indicates a higher risk estimate compared to the Normal Distribution, implying that it captures the skewness and potential for extreme losses better. Weibull Distribution: VaR = 29,813.93

The Weibull distribution provides a moderate estimate of risk, suitable for skewed data. Pareto Distribution: VaR = 29,892.76

Similar to the Weibull distribution, but slightly higher, reflecting its suitability for modeling heavy-tailed losses. Gamma Distribution: VaR = 29,821.48

This also offers a moderate risk estimate, highlighting flexibility in modeling loss distributions. Student’s t-Distribution: VaR = 21,834.58

This indicates a lower risk compared to other distributions, suggesting it may underestimate potential extreme losses. Gumbel Distribution: VaR = 24,212.03

The Gumbel distribution yields a moderate risk estimate, typically suited for modeling the distribution of maximum values. Conclusions: Highest VaR: The Log-Normal Distribution presents the highest VaR estimate at 33,591.21, indicating a substantial risk of higher losses and suggesting that this distribution captures the skewness of the loss data effectively.

Lowest VaR: The Student’s t-Distribution provides the lowest VaR at 21,834.58, which may underestimate the risk of extreme losses due to its less conservative nature.

Moderate Estimates: The Weibull, Pareto, and Gamma Distributions provide similar VaR estimates (around 29,000 to 30,000), suggesting that they effectively capture the tail risks present in the data.

Recommended Distribution: If the focus is on accounting for potential extreme losses in a risk management context, the Log-Normal Distribution would be recommended due to its higher VaR estimate.

Alternatively, for a balanced perspective, considering both the Weibull and Pareto Distributions could be beneficial, as they provide moderate estimates while still reflecting the tail behavior of the loss data.

The Normal Distribution might be less suitable for financial loss data in this scenario, as it underestimates the potential for extreme losses.

Next Steps: Conduct further analyses to verify the goodness-of-fit for the chosen distributions. Incorporate these findings into your risk management framework and stress-testing scenarios to ensure robust risk assessment and planning.

Explanation of Severity and Frequency in Risk Management In the context of risk management, understanding the concepts of frequency and severity is crucial for effective loss estimation and modeling. Here’s how each component is defined and applied, particularly in your example where frequency is modeled using a Poisson distribution and severity using a Log-Normal distribution.

Frequency Definition: Frequency refers to the number of times a specific risk event occurs within a given time period (e.g., monthly, annually).
Modeling: In your example, frequency is estimated using a Poisson distribution. This statistical distribution is appropriate for modeling count data, particularly for rare events that occur independently.

Key Characteristics: Independence: Each event occurs independently of the others. Constant Rate: The average rate (λ) of occurrence is constant over time. Discrete Events: Suitable for counting the number of occurrences of an event in fixed intervals. Application: If a bank experiences risk events (e.g., operational failures, fraud cases) at an average rate of λ per year, the Poisson distribution can help estimate the probability of observing a certain number of events (k) in that year. This allows for planning and resource allocation to mitigate potential losses.

Severity Definition: Severity refers to the financial loss associated with each occurrence of a risk event. It measures the impact of the event on the organization’s finances.
Modeling: In your example, severity is fitted to a Log-Normal distribution, which is often used for modeling financial data that is skewed and has a heavy tail.

Key Characteristics: Heavy-Tailed Nature: The Log-Normal distribution is particularly suited for losses that have a high probability of being low but can also produce very high losses. This is indicative of many financial losses where the majority are small, but a few can be catastrophic. Multiplicative Processes: Log-Normal distributions arise when the logarithm of the variable follows a normal distribution, often representing products of random variables (e.g., asset prices). Application: By modeling severity with a Log-Normal distribution, risk managers can better estimate potential losses from operational events. This helps in calculating metrics like Value at Risk (VaR) to quantify the potential financial impact of extreme events.

Combined Approach: Frequency and Severity In risk management, it’s common to analyze both frequency and severity together to assess total risk exposure effectively. The combination of these two components allows organizations to calculate expected loss, which is often referred to as Expected Loss (EL):

Expected Loss
Frequency × Severity Expected Loss=Frequency×Severity Simulation: Using Monte Carlo simulations, one can model the total financial loss over a specified period by simulating a large number of potential outcomes based on the frequency and severity distributions.

Risk Metrics: This combined approach helps in deriving key risk metrics such as:

Value at Risk (VaR): The maximum expected loss over a certain period at a given confidence level. Tail Value at Risk (TVaR): The expected loss in the worst-case scenarios beyond the VaR threshold. Summary Frequency gives insight into how often risk events occur, modeled using the Poisson distribution, which is useful for planning and response strategies. Severity quantifies the financial impact of these events, modeled using the Log-Normal distribution to account for potential extreme losses effectively. This dual modeling approach enhances an organization's ability to assess and manage risks systematically, ultimately leading to better-informed decision-making regarding risk mitigation strategies and capital allocation.

Summary of Findings After running the above analysis, you can summarize your findings as follows:
Event Counts: The distribution of event counts appears to follow a Poisson distribution with a mean of approximately 5, as designed. Most entries have relatively few events, with fewer instances of high event counts.

Loss Amount Distribution: The loss amounts are right-skewed, indicating a heavy-tailed distribution, typical of financial losses where a small number of events account for a large amount of loss.

Business Line Insights: The count of events varies across business lines. For instance, one business line may have significantly more events than others, indicating potential risk areas that need to be monitored.

Event Type Analysis: Similar to business lines, different event types may also show variation in occurrence. Certain event types may be more prevalent, suggesting areas for preventive measures.

Temporal Trends: The time series analysis shows how total losses have changed over the years, providing insights into whether losses are increasing or stabilizing.

Further Analysis Depending on your needs, you could also perform the following additional analyses:
Correlation Analysis: To understand how different variables relate to each other. Frequency-Severity Analysis: To model the distribution of frequency and severity of events. Value at Risk (VaR) Calculations: Using various distributions to assess the potential loss in financial terms. This framework provides a solid starting point for a comprehensive analysis of the dataset, highlighting trends, distributions, and potential risk factors in your data.
